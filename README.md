## INTRODUCTION
This is a power BI project on a **FICTITIOUS** toy store called **Maven Toy Stores** located in Mexico. The dataset was gotten from Maven Analytics (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?tags=10btmr8wmkqkEgJMfgtOv2).
The project was to analyze and derive insigts to answer specific questions set by Maven Analytics about the dataset;
- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
- Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
- Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
- How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

This project took me about two weeks to complete. I had initially completed it under 4 days but after watching a youtube video by Microsoft Reactor on Documenting Data Analysis Project on Github (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLIwyoPWrHs&t=1706s), I got inspired to make my report more interactive and thus began days of leearning to finally get my final report.
